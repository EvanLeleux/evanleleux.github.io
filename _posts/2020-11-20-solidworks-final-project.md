My team decided to create an outerspace rover that would serve as a mobile home base for any futuristic space explorer. The "Juggernaut" has a workspace in the back with an extendable ramp, an airlocked living quarters, and a rotating driving cabin. The wheels and rotating cabin allow the vehicle to remain completely operational even in the event it is flipped over. The wheels are also divided into separate sections that can extend using hydralics. This allows for navigation over extremely rough and arduous terrain.


Through this project I applied learned techniques from class to sketch prototypes and draft assemblies. I collaborated with my team members to evenly divide the work and keep each other accountable in a virtual environment. We designed, properly dimensioned, and assembled 3D CAD models using SOLIDWORKS. We created fully dimensioned drawings and exploded assembly drawings, before presenting a full report of the project using Microsoft PowerPoint to peers and the professor.
