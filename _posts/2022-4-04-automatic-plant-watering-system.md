As a personal project to make sure my basil plant wouldn't die from lack of watering / lack of sun when I am away on trips or whatever, I decided to rig up a quick, automatic watering system. It is really, really simple but I think it turned out pretty good. I took a sheet of wood, laser cut out the box sides including ventilation holes and a power cable hole, wood glued it together and added a few simple components: 5v power supply, Arduino Pro Micro, 5v relay, Capacitance Moisture Sensor, and a small water pump.
