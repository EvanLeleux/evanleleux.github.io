I interned as an engineer at local company that specializes in automating manufacturing processes for a number of Fortune 500 companies. Mainly focusing on the control systems, I set up and programmed PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) to work with a wide range of sensors and output to solenoid valves, relays, servos, and more. 

I was required to quickly learn how to read engineering drawings, check the panels against the drawings, make sure safety requirements were met, and collaborate with a range of other engineers. In my downtime, I made use of the company's wide array of training videos and learned as much as I could about real-world engineering.
