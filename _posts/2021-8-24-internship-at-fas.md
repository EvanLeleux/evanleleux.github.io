I recentlly interned as an engineer at local company (Factory Automation Systems) that specializes in automating manufacturing processes for a number of Fortune 500 companies. My time was mainly focused on control systems and panel design. I set up and programmed PLCs to work with a wide range of sensors and output to solenoid valves, relays, and servos. 

Quickly learning how to read engineering drawings, checking panels against drawings, making sure safety requirements were met, and collaborating with a wide range of other engineers were essential to be successful. In my downtime, I made use of the company's wide array of training videos and projects to make sure I never stopped learning.
