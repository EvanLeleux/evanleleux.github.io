Created a Battleship Command line game using Java. Two players first set out 5 1x1 ships in a 5x5 playing field, and then they take turns shooting at the others players ships. The game ends when one player has sunk all 5 of the other players ships. There are checks in both the building and attacking stages to prevent a tile being chosen twice or out of bounds.

Learned about Java loops, conditionals, separate Object classes, and user input.
