I am a part of a Vertically Integrated Project (ViP) that researches "Low Cost Aerial Autonomy" in conjunction with Sandia National Labs. I was a key member of a ground robot and drone 'teaming' sub-team of the research group. We researched and prototyped having a drone provide support to a ground vehicle through the use of a winch. I focused on the electrical and software side of a drone while also researching and helping design a micro-spine setup that would allow the drone to secure itself to rough surfaces and be an anchor for a ground vehicle to pull itself up a wall, out of mud, etc.
