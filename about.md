title: About me 
---

<p style="text-align: left;">    Hello, my name is Evan Leleux. I was born in Savannah, Georgia, but I moved to central Louisiana before I can remember and was raised there. I currently attend the Georgia Institute of Technology (ironic right?) pursing my passion with a degree in Computer Science and a concentration in Intelligence and Devices.</p>

I chose CompSci because I have always had a talent/love for solving puzzles with elegant solutions or creating something real that serves a purpose. My concentration goes precisely with that. I want to be able to create something that not only solves a problem but also learns and grows even more effective/efficient. Being a second year student, I am looking to gain experience and knowledge in all I can. I delve into whatever I can in the pursuit of hopefully learning something useful.
Currently, I am getting more involved in my campus life as a Prototype Instructor in the Invention Studio, but I am eagerly looking for more opportunities to grow and learn. I am also a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilion fraternity.
